# Next Components

Here we keep components that are scoped to the nextJS framework. A quick examples are

- Meta: for Head components and Meta Tags
- Link : Wrapper components that compose the `next/link` with our style framework
- Image: Wrapper components that compose the `next/image` with our style framework
